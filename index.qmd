Hi there! I'm Jason, my hometown is Shanghai, China! I am currently a student at Pomona College, CA, where I am studying neuroscience and data science. I am also a part of a club called Health Bridges where I get to volunteer at Pomona Valley Hospital as a non-medical translator! In my free time, I like to play the guitar (Chinese folk songs are my favorite!). Look around my website to learn more!

I used Quarto to build this website, the link to the repository is here: <https://github.com/ASTROXXXXX/ASTROXXXXX.github.io>
