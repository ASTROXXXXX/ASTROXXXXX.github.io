  Analysis of Parfumo Fragrance Dataset from TidyTuesday
format: html
---

This dataset contains information about perfumes webscraped from Parfumo, a community of perfume enthusiasts. The data was originally collected and made publicly available by [Olga G.](https://www.kaggle.com/olgagmiufana1), and was later featured in the TidyTuesday project for public data exploration and visualization.

Play around with the interactive dashboard below to explore perfume rating distributions by brand presented by box plots. The goal is to visually analyze trends and preferences across different perfume manufacturers based on community ratings.
