This dataset comes from the **National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP)**, one of the most comprehensive federal sources of childcare data at the county level. It includes detailed cost information by age group, geography, and provider type. The data was prepared for the TidyTuesday project by Thomas Mock and is available publicly for analysis.
